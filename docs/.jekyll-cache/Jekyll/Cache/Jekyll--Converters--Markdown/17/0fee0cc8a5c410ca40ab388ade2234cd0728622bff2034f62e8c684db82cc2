<p>Welcome to the IIIT Programming Club. We are just a bunch of people who love to code and participate in programming contests! Programming can be fun, and we are here to prove exactly that.</p>

<p>Currently, due to restrictions imposed by the pandemic, most communications happen on the discord server. However, all important posts are also put up on our facebook page.</p>
