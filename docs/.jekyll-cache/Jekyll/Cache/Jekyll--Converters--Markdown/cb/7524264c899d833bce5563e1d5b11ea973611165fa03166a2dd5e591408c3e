<p>The goal is to cover a series of CP topics during the summer vacations. We will setup weekly contests and each contest will be based on a particular topic. The topic and the corresponding reading material and practice problems will be shared by the beginning of each week, and there will be a contest near the end of the week based on the topic.</p>

<p>The idea is to build up slowly from beginner topics to cover more advanced ones. This is the annual â€˜tentativeâ€™ list of topics we usually aim to cover.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Implementation and Greedy</li>
  <li>Basic Number Theory</li>
  <li>Binary Search, Ternary Search and Sliding Window</li>
  <li>Recursion and Backtracking</li>
  <li>Dynamic Programming</li>
  <li>Graphs - DFS and BFS</li>
  <li>Graphs - Dijkstras, ???</li>
  <li>Probability and Expectation</li>
  <li>SQRT Decomposition and Moâ€™s Algorithm</li>
  <li>Segment Tree and Lazy Propagation</li>
  <li>Bitmasking and SOS Dynamic Programming</li>
  <li>Digit DP and DP on Trees</li>
  <li>Strings</li>
  <li>Advanced Number Theory</li>
</ol>

<p>More topics may be added later depending on requests and on the time we get.</p>
