# Summer Training

The goal is to cover a series of CP topics during the summer vacations. We will setup weekly contests and each contest will be based on a particular topic. The topic and the corresponding reading material and practice problems will be shared by the beginning of each week, and there will be a contest near the end of the week based on the topic.

The idea is to build up slowly from beginner topics to cover more advanced ones. This is the annual 'tentative' list of topics we usually aim to cover. 

1. C++ STL
2. Ad Hoc, Implementation & Greedy
3. Sorting & Searching
4. Recursion and Introduction to Dynamic Programming
5. Graphs - DFS, BFS & Applications
6. Graphs - DSUs & MSTs
7. Graphs - Shortest Paths
8. Intermediate topics in Dynamic Programming
9. Number Theory
10. Strings
11. Combinatorics & Probability
12. Flows
13. Treaps
14. Centroid Decomposition
15. Euler Tour Technique + Heavy-Light Decomposition
