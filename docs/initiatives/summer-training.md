# Summer Training

The goal is to cover a series of CP topics during the summer vacations. We will setup weekly contests and each contest will be based on a particular topic. The topic and the corresponding reading material and practice problems will be shared by the beginning of each week, and there will be a contest near the end of the week based on the topic.

The idea is to build up slowly from beginner topics to cover more advanced ones. This is the annual 'tentative' list of topics we usually aim to cover. 

1. Implementation and Greedy
2. Basic Number Theory
3. Binary Search, Ternary Search and Sliding Window
4. Recursion and Backtracking
5. Dynamic Programming
6. Graphs - DFS and BFS
7. Graphs - Dijkstras, ???
8. Probability and Expectation
9. SQRT Decomposition and Mo's Algorithm
10. Segment Tree and Lazy Propagation
11. Bitmasking and SOS Dynamic Programming
12. Digit DP and DP on Trees
13. Strings
14. Advanced Number Theory

More topics may be added later depending on requests and on the time we get.
