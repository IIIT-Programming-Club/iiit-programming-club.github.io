# Lockout Tournament
This is a 1v1 style lockout tournament that the programming club conducts. A lockout is a 1v1 match between two contestants. Both the contestants are provided with a set of 5 problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). Fastest AC to the problem gives them points. The contestant with more number of points at the end of the contest wins!
