# Meets
There are always new topics to be learned in the world of competitve programming, even for the most experienced of coders. We attempt to hold regular sessions on various different topics ranging from basic meets for people just getting started with CP to more advanced meets. 

## Basic Meets
For the newcomers and beginners. There are always enough beginners in UG1, UG2, UG3, etc. You can find common meet ideas in our youtube videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfvb0BPfXW0aFgzHWsGmjQ).

## Advanced Meets
These meets are aimed at those of you who are relatively more experienced CPers. Any teams aiming to make it to the regionals and perform should definitely attend them!
