# Team Contests

Before the annual ICPC regionals, we hold a series of weekly / bi-weekly team contests where all IIIT-H teams are encouraged to participate. The contests will be ICPC style mock contests so that all teams can get an experience of what they will face and get a chance to practice working on team solving. 

A list of the previous team contests conducted can be found [here](https://codeforces.com/group/yny9prUF8z/contests).
