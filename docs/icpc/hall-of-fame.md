The best rank ever achieved by an Indian team at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) was **rank 18** in 2012 by 2 teams from IIT-Delhi and IIIT-Hyderabad. IIIT-H also managed to send teams to the prestigious ACM-ICPC World Finals for 7 years in a row at one point. ICPC is something you cannot *not* hear about as a student in IIIT, and understandably so. The college has had a rich past of teams qualifying for and posting admirable performances at the ICPC World Finals. We proudly present to you, our Hall of Fame :)

# IIIT's ICPC run over the years

## 2020-21 - ???

The coronavirus pandemic has changed a lot of things and as of now the status of Asia-west and WF qualifications are not set in stone. The regionals also saw a wide range of teams taking the top spots. Team **Holy Trinity** (Gaurav Sultane, Arnav Juneja, Sayantan Jana) has however, secured #4 at the online Amritapuri regional. It is too soon to say if they will qualify or not but our hopes and prayers are with them!

## 2019-20 - tesla_protocol

**tesla_protocol** from IIIT-H faced a rocky set of regional rounds where they ranked #6 in the Amritapuri regional and #4 in the Kanpur regional, thus qualifying for Asia-west. Asia-West did not start off smoothly either. At around 1.5 hours into the contest, they only had 3 solves. To give context, the top team had 6. But despite the insurmountable odds they faced, they pulled off an incredible comeback to solve a total of 9 problems by the end and finished 7th. Excluding the teams that had qualified directly via regionals, they comfortably came in *third* in slots at Asia-West.

The 2020 WFs stand postponed as of now due to the coronavirus pandemic.
