# ICPC Camp!

The Inter-College Competitive Programming Camp is an initiative that has been in the works for quite some time. We've prepared this camp in collaboration with some of the top colleges in India, and we are excited to bring you an opportunity to excel further in competitive programming and team contests!

The first iteration of camp is a closed camp where the best from IIIT-H, IIT-K, IIT-M, IIT-D, IIT-R, IIT-P, IIT-G, IIT-KGP, IIT-BHU, IIT-BBS, IIIT-D and BITS Pilani can meet to compete and share their knowledge with everyone. We aim to foster a vibrant community to collaborate, learn and grow, so that anyone that aspires to excel in competitive programming can be guided by some of the best.

## Here's what the ICPC Camp has in store for you

### Competitions
These contests will provide the perfect practice ground to hone your skills for the team-based programming challenges, a cornerstone of ICPC. We'll be conducting 8+ weeks of contests every Sunday, so keep your calendars blocked! These will be conducted on a Codeforces group.

### Educational Meets
Elevate your programming knowledge through educational meets led by Masters, Grandmasters, and World Finalists. Learn advanced topics, strategies, and techniques from the best, ensuring you always have something new to learn.

### Network and Connect
Meet like-minded individuals from various colleges, exchange ideas, and build friendships that will last beyond the camp. Collaboration is key, and this is your chance to create lasting bonds with your peers. Considering that it's harder for many teams from the same college to go to regionals and meet teams from other colleges, this would help you bridge that gap.

### Prizes
As an added incentive, the top 9 teams from the ICPC Camp will receive T-shirts, based on the performance in the contests that will be conducted.

We are beyond excited to welcome you to this unparalleled learning journey. We hope that we not only advance the Competitive Programming culture in our college, but across colleges in India too!
