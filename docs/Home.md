# IIIT Programming Club

Welcome to the IIIT Programming Club. We are just a bunch of people who love to code and participate in programming contests! Programming can be fun, and we are here to prove exactly that. 

Currently, due to restrictions imposed by the pandemic, most communications happen on the discord server. However, all important posts are also put up on our facebook page. 

To know more about our activities please visit the activities link on the left.
