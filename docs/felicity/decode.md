# Decode

Yet another annual programming contest conducted as part of our annual techno-cultural fest, Felicity. This contest turns the usual format on its head. Tired of writing AC solutions? We’ve got you covered! You’ll be given problems and their buggy code submissions. Your job will be to figure out a test case where the buggy solution fails.

A list of the previous Decode's conducted can be found below
