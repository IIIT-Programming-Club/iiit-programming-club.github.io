# Fool's Programming

Love the thrills of a programming contest but bored by the monotonous pattern of normal contests. Have a knack for finding clues and thinking laterally, we are proud to present Foolâ€™s Programming 2020 as a part of Threads, Felicity IIIT Hyderabad.

The problems can not only have unusual solutions, but will also have bizarre problem statements that can make one scratch their brains. Deciphering the questions will be more challenging than solving them. You'll need eagle eyes to spot the clues and hints hidden in the questions posed to you. Hope you can think on the same plane as the setters ;)
