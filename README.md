This repository contains the source code of the Programming Club's website. Feel free to make a pull request in case you wish to contribute, or open an issue if you find some error on the website.

This website aims to serve as a documentation of all the work and events we've conducted in the past, the achievements attained as a result of the club's efforts, and an honorary remembrance of all the past admins of the club.

Further, we hope this website can be a common resource that can be shared to all those who wish to begin their journey in Competitive Programming. Starting from a FAQ, to links to the resources we found useful on our journey.
